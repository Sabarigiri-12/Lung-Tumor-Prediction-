Lung Tumor Prediction using Deep Learning

Project Overview
      This project is a Lung Tumor Prediction System built using Deep Learning and Image Processing techniques. The system allows users to upload lung CT scan/X-ray images through a web interface, and the trained model predicts whether the image indicates a tumor (malignant/benign) or normal lungs.

      The aim is to provide a decision-support system for early detection of lung tumors, which can help in faster diagnosis and treatment planning.
